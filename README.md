# Project1: Array Management with Statistical Operations

## Overview
Project1 is a Java implementation of an integer array management system that provides various functionalities such as adding values, calculating statistics (e.g., min, max, range, average), checking for duplicates, and handling array capacity. This project aims to demonstrate a custom implementation of array-related operations while utilizing object-oriented principles.

## Features
- **Array Operations**: Add, remove, and set values at specific indices.
- **Statistical Functions**: Get the minimum, maximum, range, and average of the array values.
- **Capacity Management**: Check if the array is full or empty, and get its current capacity.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Check if the array contains any duplicate values.
- **Random Value Generation**: Add random values to the array.
- **Exception Handling**: Handle various exceptions such as index out of bounds or full array conditions.
